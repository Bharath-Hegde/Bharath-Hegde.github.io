I'm a final year undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) pursuing a BE in Computer Science. I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate thesis at [R-PAD Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/), [Carnegie Mellon Univeristy](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. David Held](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/david-held/) where I'm working on robot learning for deformable object manipulation. I'm broadly interested in robots that can learn to do interesting things. 

Previously, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Sougata Sen](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/sougata-sen/) at SenseLab, where I tinkered with ESP's for spatial localisation. Last summer, I worked at [DevRev.ai](https://devrev.ai/) as a software development intern.

When I'm not wondering about the [meaning of life](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLypiXJdtIca7i8IrNye4IenjnUCP9LF35), you can find me dancing, reading or playing badminton!
